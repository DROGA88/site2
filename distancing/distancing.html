<p>Distancing (16mm, 10min, Color, 2019)
<br>
<br>
<br>

Shot on 16mm colour film, Distancing documents the logistics and poetics of Miko Revereza’s decision to leave the United States and return to the Philippines. 'My ticket is one way', the filmmaker explains to his grandmother as she suddenly realizes he isn't coming back. Distancing is a film about this personal realization; to leave and thus become exiled from the country where he was raised. The film acts as a memoir and cites a lineage of statelessness in cinema. It is a personal document of the moment anticipating a great departure.

 "...with Revereza especially adept at capturing the banal poetry of mechanical movement through his many shots of revolving conveyor belts without luggage (or just one stray suitcase circling around for no one to pick up), depopulated escalators and elevators, moving walkways and inter-terminal busses speeding through tunnels. Each one of these images becomes a dynamic piece of moving geometry, a rhythmic plane of diagonal, vertical, and horizontal lines that continuously change and shift."  <br>
