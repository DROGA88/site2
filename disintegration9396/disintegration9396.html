“it becomes all the more important for us to pay attention to the aesthetic choices of an undocumented filmmaker like Miko Revereza, who clearly is not interested in state-centered visibility. With films like Disintegration, Revereza critiques the path toward citizenship paved by integrationist, assimilationist values and, I argue, forges an important alternative “dis-integrating” path and mode of cultural and artistic expression”
